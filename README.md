# Inverse Analysis and Hybrid Reinforced Concrete (HRC) Design Software

**Version:** Beta  
**Developer:** Devansh Patel  
**Contact:** dpatel52@asu.edu  
**Platform:** MATLAB Standalone Application (No MATLAB license required)

---

## üîç Overview

This software provides a standalone graphical interface for performing inverse analysis, moment-curvature simulation, and design of fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC), ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC), and hybrid reinforced concrete (HRC) sections.

Built using closed-form analytical models, the software is capable of:
- Simulating the complete flexural response of FRC/UHPC beams
- Performing inverse analysis using EN 14651 or ASTM C1609 test data
- Modeling tension, compression, and reinforcement behavior using parametric stress-strain laws
- Real-time visualization of stress/strain distribution, moment-curvature, and load-deflection plots
- Generating PDF and Excel reports for documentation and design use

## üì• Installation

This application is distributed as a **standalone MATLAB executable**, and **does not require a MATLAB license**.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
- During installation, the software will **download MATLAB Runtime** (~1 GB) from the web. Installation time may vary depending on your internet speed.
- You may encounter a **Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warning**. This is expected for new applications not yet digitally signed.  
  Click **‚ÄúMore Info‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúRun Anyway‚Äù** to proceed.
- The software is safe and poses no security risk.
